Hi everyone.
[Make sure you have read Readme. md] 
As you see the website is simple and easy to use, I have faced some problems, first is the big number 
of errors in the "application.py" file, due to the inexperience in Flask's library that lead me to see 
"Internal server error" every time I run this project. Despite errors, I have fixed all of them and go 
ahead to face the second problem! The style of pages, it's the first time I make a project using Flask,
so the pages must be designed in a way that won't lead to an incompatibility, so what is the solution?!
The solution is to use bootstrap and make an abstract file for pages, which makes work easier. If you see 
the code you'll notice that my code is close to that of pset9 because the ideas are close too, the 'login, 
buy, index, register' pages are quite the same.The last problem I have faced is the
malfunction of on/off button in my computer, which forced me to write this file using mobile.
