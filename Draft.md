Hi everyone.
In this blog, I will show you my moments by working on this project. As you see the website is
simple and easy to use, I have faced some problems.

first is the big number of errors in the "application.py" file, due to the inexperience in 
Flask's library leads me to see "Internal server error" every time I run this project.
Despite errors, I have fixed all of them and go ahead to face the second problem! The
style of pages, it's the first time I make a project using Flask, so the pages must be
designed in a way that won't lead to an incompatibility, so what is the solution?! The solution
is to use bootstrap and make an abstract file for pages "main.html", which makes work easier.
If you see the code you'll notice that my code is close to that of pset9 because the ideas
are close too, the 'login, buy, index, register' pages are quite the same. The last problem 
I have faced is the malfunction of the on/off button in my computer, which forced me to write this
file using mobile. thank goodness the computer's on/off button works, and I'm editing this file using it.

Finally, I want to say something: " if you have an error after running 100 times don't feel sad
just google-it !" without google you'll do nothing.
