## What makes this project beautiful   
### Code is clear
when you read the code you'll find everything clear, algorithms are   
very simple, even I have used flask, but the code is written with   
the basics of it. The best thing is that all html pages have an      
abstract page called main.html, that makes the code more clear  

### Idea is simple  
This project is about a market website, so no worry about understating    
the concept of it, and you can know the function of page from its name,  
by example the page *buy* is for buying a package, *bill* for displaying   
the bill, and so on.    

### It's useful  
As we know the products shown in the table are a part of our country identity,      
**Lebanon** and very traditional, and usually the markets that sell like these     
products don't use technology, so this project idea **"local baverege market"**    
is a little new, and a way to give these products a life in the world shop.       

## Problems I have faced during the work **to be continued**
