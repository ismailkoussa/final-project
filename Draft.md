# About project  
## About website
This is a website for a local beverage institution **Koussa**.   
It uses Flask's library   
It contains a main page, a page for registering an account, another for login, another for buying items,    
another for a bill, and the last for displaying error messages.  

## How to run the project    
This project uses Flask, which is a Python library, 
so make sure to install Python and Flask before you
try to run this project, follow the link in below to
install Python and Flask on both windows and linux   

[install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Why I have chosen cs50   
### Education  
First, it's very important to say that I'm a Lebanese University student,     
and when I was in the first year, the courses were very far from programming,   
it's all about Physics and some unimportant mathematics, so I stood up and
said, No!   
I'll not pass this year without a real programming education, after  
that, I asked my friend that is a programmer for some courses, and Cs50 was one   
of them. I never regretted enrolling in this course, it's very useful, you'll be  
shocked if you know that it contains more than 4 semesters of programming materials  
in my university. take this example: no backend course in the first 4 semesters.

### Simplicity   
Cs50 is very simple to learn, the course is divided into weeks, and every  
week contains a long video **lecture** and some other shorts **shorts**, so   
the ideas have a straight way to enter your mind! then there are some problems   
**lab** and **problem set**, that fix these ideas and teach you how to use them.


## What makes this project beautiful   
### Code is clear
when you read the code you'll find everything clear, algorithms are   
very simple, even I have used Flask, but the code is written with   
the basics of it. The best thing is that all html pages have an      
abstract page called main.html, that makes the code more clear  

### Idea is simple  
This project is about a market website, so no worry about understating    
the concept of it, and you can know the function of page from its name,  
by example the page *buy* is for buying a package, *bill* for displaying   
the bill, and so on.    

### It's useful  
As we know the products shown in the table are a part of our country identity,      
**Lebanon** and very traditional, and usually the markets that sell like these     
products don't use technology, so this project idea **"local baverege market"**    
is a little new, and a way to give these products a life in the world shop.       

## Problems I have faced during the work    
### Style   
The style of pages wasn't very well, I had to create a CSS style page     
for every HTML page, as any beginner thinks, but no! work is easier     
than that, all I had to do is to create an abstract page called "main",   
in *templates* folder. It's not easy to explain how it works, you     
can see its code and its *style* page and discover a new way of working. 

### Turn on/off button    
Please don't laugh, because during work pressure, my computer on/off button    
stopped working, which led me to wait many days without coding until I fixed it.     

## What this project taught me   
This project demonstrates the importance of backend, no doubt that every   
a junior developer that only works with HTML, CSS, js knows about backend   
but when a person uses it, he will love it, its another world! it makes    
developing very easier, exactly by using **Flask** it's like *backbones*      
it connects all pages by its variables in HTML pages and collects    
the information from forms and throws it in tables. In the image below    
this piece of code shows how Flask work with tables and variables.

This is another image showing the collection of informations from forms after submitting    
and the error messages based on these informations :

## Have a look at the website   
### login page   
First, when you run the code on the top you'll be directed to login page

![project-1](https://github.com/ismailkoussa/final-project/blob/master/readme%20images/project-1.PNG)     

as you see there is a form containing 2 inputs for *username* and *password*.    
make sure to enter the informations correctly, otherwise an error message will    
be displayed in a page that you'll be directed to: **apology**    

### register page    
If you don't have an account you can register one by clicking on *register* in the header as below:

![project-4](https://github.com/ismailkoussa/final-project/blob/master/readme%20images/project-4.PNG).

when you register for a new account you'll be directed to login page again.    

### index page
After you login correctly you'll be directed to index page, this is the main page of the website,
it contains a table that represents the products of the institution. 

![project-2](https://github.com/ismailkoussa/final-project/blob/master/readme%20images/project-2.PNG)

The header of this page contains two links, one for the page itself and another for a page called "buy".
lets dive into that page!   

### buy page
When you open this page you'll see a form that contains 2 inputs and 2 buttons. The first input collects   
the *product name* wich you want to buy, the second takes a number(integer) that represents the number of items.   
Next, there is a button **buy** that submits the form. You can submit it as much you want. In below of  
this button there another called *view bill* which directs you to **bill page**.

![project-3](https://github.com/ismailkoussa/final-project/blob/master/readme%20images/project-3.PNG)

### bill page
In this page the bill is displayed in a table with 3 columns:  
* **name** *name of item you've buyed*
* **Quantity** *number of items*
* **price** *price of one piece multiplyed by Quantity*   

and finally under the page the total price of package is there.

### apology page  
I will not show you all the error messages, I'll let   
you know by running this project, but in the pictures  
below there is some of them    

If you enterd an unexist username     

![apology-1](https://github.com/ismailkoussa/final-project/blob/master/readme%20images/apology-1.PNG)  

If you enterd an unexist product name   

![apology-2](https://github.com/ismailkoussa/final-project/blob/master/readme%20images/apology-2.PNG)  

If you enterd an incorrect password

## Finally     
Every developer should continue learning and developing himself before developing pages    
because every day there is a new trick that saves a lot of effort and code lines.    
**Don't hesitate to comment on my project if you want to tell me anything!**
