## What makes this project beautiful   
### Code is clear
when you read the code you'll find everything clear, algorithms are   
very simple, even I have used flask, but the code is written with   
the basics of it.   

### Idea is simple  
This project is about a market website, so no worry about understating    
the concept of it, and you can know the function of page from its name,  
by example the page *buy* is for buying a package, *bill* for displaying   
the bill, and so on.
