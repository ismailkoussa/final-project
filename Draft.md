# About project  

## How to run the project    
This project uses Flask, which is a python library, 
so make sure to install python and flask before you
try to run this project, follow the link in below to
install python and flask on both windows and linux   

[install python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Why I have chosen cs50   
### Education  
First, it's very important to say that I'm a Lebanese University student,     
and when I was in the first year, the courses were very far from programming,   
it's all about Physics and some unimportant mathematics, so I stood up and
said, No!, I'll not pass this year without a real programming education, after  
that, I asked my friend that is a programmer for some courses, and Cs50 was one   
of them. I never regretted enrolling in this course, it's very useful, you'll be  
shocked if you know that it contains more than 4 semesters of programming materials  
in my university. take this example: no backend course in the first 4 semesters.

### samplest   
Cs50 is very sample to learn from, the course is divided into weeks, and every  
week contains a long video **lecture** and some other shorts **shorts**, so   
the ideas have a straight way to enter your mind! then there are some problems   
**lab** and **problem set**, that fix these ideas and teach you how to use them.


## What makes this project beautiful   
### Code is clear
when you read the code you'll find everything clear, algorithms are   
very simple, even I have used flask, but the code is written with   
the basics of it. The best thing is that all html pages have an      
abstract page called main.html, that makes the code more clear  

### Idea is simple  
This project is about a market website, so no worry about understating    
the concept of it, and you can know the function of page from its name,  
by example the page *buy* is for buying a package, *bill* for displaying   
the bill, and so on.    

### It's useful  
As we know the products shown in the table are a part of our country identity,      
**Lebanon** and very traditional, and usually the markets that sell like these     
products don't use technology, so this project idea **"local baverege market"**    
is a little new, and a way to give these products a life in the world shop.       

## Problems I have faced during the work    
### Style   
The style of pages wasn't very well, I had to create a CSS style page     
for every HTML page, as any beginner thinks, but no! work is easier     
than that, all I had to do is to create an abstract page called "main",   
in *templates* folder. It's not easy to explain how it works, you     
can see its code and its *style* page and discover a new way of working. 

### Turn on/off button    
Please don't laugh, because during work pressure, my computer on/off button    
stopped working, which led me to wait many days without coding until I fixed it.     

## What this project taught me   
This project demonstrates the importance of backend, no doubt that every   
a junior developer that only works with HTML, CSS, js knows about backend   
but when a person uses it, he will love it, its another world!, it makes    
developing very easier, exactly by using **Flask** it's like *backbones*      
it connects all pages by its variables in HTML pages and collects    
the information from forms and throws it in tables. In the image below    
this piece of code shows how flask work with tables and variables.

This is another image showing the collection of informations from forms after submitting    
and the error messages based on these informations :

## Finally     
Every developer should continue learning and developing himself before developing pages    
because every day there is a new trick that saves a lot of effort and code lines.
