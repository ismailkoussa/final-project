Hi 
This is a website for a local beverage institution "Koussa". 
First, when you run the code on the top you'll be directed to login page

![project-1](https://github.com/ismailkoussa/final-project/blob/master/readme%20images/project-1.PNG)

you can also register for a new account as below:

![project-4](https://github.com/ismailkoussa/final-project/blob/master/readme%20images/project-4.PNG).

when you register for a new account you'll be directed to login page again.
After you login correctly you'll be directed to index page, this is the main page of the website,
it contains a table that represents the products of the institution. 

![project-2](https://github.com/ismailkoussa/final-project/blob/master/readme%20images/project-2.PNG)

The header of this page contains two links, one for the page itself and another for a page called "buy". 
lets dive into that page! When you open it you'll see a form that
contains 2 inputs and 2 buttons. The first input collects the name "symbol" of the product you want to buy, the second 
takes a number(integer) that represents the number of items. Next, there is a button "buy" that submits the form and adds
your request to a table displayed in the "bill" page having the second button "view bill" as a link to it.

![project-3](https://github.com/ismailkoussa/final-project/blob/master/readme%20images/project-3.PNG)

No doubt that you can buy more than a product by just repeat filling the form,
then you'll see the bill on the "bill" page.

![project-5](https://github.com/ismailkoussa/final-project/blob/master/readme%20images/project-5.PNG)

By using this website you must be very accurate, every single error you do will display an error message on a page called "apology"
that you'll direct to. I don't want to list the mistakes you can do, I will let you discover the website.
