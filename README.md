Hi 
This is a website for a local beverage institution "Koussa". 
First, when you run the code on the top you'll be directed to a page called index, this is the main page of the website,
it contains a table that represents the products of the institution. The header of this page contains two links, one for 
the page itself and another for a page called "buy", lets dive into that page! When you open it you'll see a form that
contains 2 inputs and 2 buttons. The first input collects the name "symbol" of the product you want to buy, the second 
takes a number(integer) that represents the number of items. Next, there is a button "buy" that submits the form and adds
your request to a table displayed in the "bill" page having the second button "view bill" as a link to it. No doubt that you 
can buy more than a product by just repeat filling the form, then you'll see the bill on the "bill" page.
By using this website you must be very accurate, every single error you do will display an error message on a page called "apology"
that you'll direct to. I don't want to list the mistakes you can do, I will let you discover the website.
